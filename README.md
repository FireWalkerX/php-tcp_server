There is currently no documentation for this server.

Here is a brief example of how to run it on linux.

Change to the directory where you cloned the repository, then execute the following command.
    ./server.php
By default, the server binds to all IPV4 and IPV6 addresses, and is available at port 6000. For help on the available commands within the server, type /help.

Contributions are welcome, but please stay within the existing coding standards within the file, no indentations, no extreme modification of the code layout.

Of course, you're free to fork repositories and submit pull requests, I'm more than willing to take a look at any changes people may wish to make.

There is currently no documentation for this server.

Here is a brief example of how to run it on linux.

Change to the directory where you cloned the repository, then execute the following command.

    ./server.php

By default, the server binds to all IPV4 and IPV6 addresses, and is available at port 6000. For help on the available commands within the server, type /help.

Contributions are welcome, but please stay within the existing coding standards within the files, no extreme modification of the code layout. Keep variable standards defined as they currently are, and if defining other variables or creating other functions, keep the layout similar to what it is already.

Please note that the code may undergoe extreme changes, since I do have several ideas of my own on how to make it better than it is at the moment, and more easily extendible.

Of course, you're free to fork repositories and submit pull requests, I'm more than willing to take a look at any changes people may wish to make.
